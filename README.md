## Hi there ğŸ‘‹
I am currently a student at WGU pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science.
Fun fact about me is that I am a licensed falconer in the state of South Carolina. I have been working with birds of prey for over two years now, and have also worked with Draft Horses in the carriage industry for several years.
